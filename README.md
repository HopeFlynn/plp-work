# Welcome to my Python PLP Course repository!

This repository contains the exercises, projects, and notes from my learning journey through the Python PLP (Power Learn Project) course. I'm using this space to practice and build my skills in Python programming.


Feel free to explore the code and follow along if you're also learning Python!
